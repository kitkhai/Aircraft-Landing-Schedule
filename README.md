# Aircraft Landing Optimisation
This is an expansion upon the model presented by <i>"Algorithms for single- and multiple-runway Aircraft Landing Problem"</i>.  
This project extends the consideration of the original model by considering additional factors such as runway-aircraft size & weather.  
As such, we addedd additional constraints such as:
- Ensuring that aircrafts can only land on runways that that are sufficiently large
- Ensuring aircrafts can only land when there is good weather

The data used in this project are modified from the sources stated in the original research paper.
